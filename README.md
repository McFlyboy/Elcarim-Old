Previously known as "*Project 1996*".
<br />
This is a game-dev project I've been working on-and-off on since november 2016.
<br />
I'm programming it in Java with the use of [LWJGL3](https://www.lwjgl.org/).
<br />
The project is currently a re-code of the old version of the game.
I decided to re-code it so that it would be easier to write code faster.
**The old code was super messy :P**
