# Project 1996
Also known as "*Elcarim*".
<br />
This is a game-dev project I've been working on-and-off on since november 2016.
I stopped working on this version in 2018 to re-create the game's code in C++, and continue development from there.
<br />
I made this version in Java with the use of [LWJGL3](https://www.lwjgl.org/).
<br />
Further development on the full game in C++ is being done in a different repo: https://github.com/McFlyboy/Elcarim
